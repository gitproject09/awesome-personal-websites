This is a list of awesome personal websites I came across this year (2020).

Personal branding is very important in the world today. You need a good personal website. Check out the ones here when you build your own site and need some inspiration.

The list has people in different walks of life. Some are established scientists, tech celebrities; some are seasoned engineers, industry veterans;
some are Twitter's favorite, rising stars in their fields; some are artists, Youtubers, content creators; some are students trying to find a job, or share what they have learned recently.

Some of the websites have great visuals, some have rich content, some have intriguing hooks to sell you their ideas or business, some are just cute. They all inspired me in different ways. Perhaps you will find them interesting and have new ideas about how to build your own.

Note:
- This list is heavily biased toward ML researchers, engineers, data scientists because they make up most of the people I follow on Twitter for now.
- This is not trying to be a "comprehensive" list of anything, just A list that I happen to come across and take notes.
- I'll add more in the future.
